# Data Caching Policy Example

This example shows how to use cache on a PDK policy.

## Policy use case

An antique store that buys and sells items needs to track the stock of each item in its catalog and who buys it. To track the inventory movement, the company uses an API where each unique path represents a different item.

Because the storeâ€™s catalog items in stock change constantly during business hours but are frozen outside of business hours, the server manager decides to implement a caching policy that caches the stock during non-business hours.

The server manager implements the caching policy as follows:

1. The policy first checks the time of each incoming request.
2. If the request is outside of business hours and if a response for the path has not been previously cached, the policy caches the response.
3. The policy returns the cached response for all following requests to the path outside of business hours.
4. When business hours resume, the policy clears the cache and is ready to cache new responses during the next period of non-business hours.

To reuse the policy, the amount of cached requests and the non-business hours are configurable.

An error in the caching flow should not make a request fail. By default, the caching policy does not block requests.

## Integration tests

The integration tests included in the `tests` directory show the policy behavior in a scenario where it always caches all requests, but the max cache entries is just 1. Therefore, it will always cache the latest request, but with every new cached request, it forgets the previous cache entry.

## Run the Policy Locally

To test the policy:

1.  Run the `build` command to compile the policy:

    ``` ssh
    make build
    ```

2. Configure the `playground/config/api.yaml` as follows:

    ``` yaml
    # Copyright 2023 Salesforce, Inc. All rights reserved.
    ---
    apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ApiInstance
    metadata:
    name: ingress-http
    spec:
    address: http://0.0.0.0:8081
    services:
        upstream:
        address: http://backend
        routes:
            - config:
                destinationPath: /anything/echo/
    policies:
        - policyRef:
            name: awesome-caching-v1-0-impl
        config:
            max_cached_values: 10
            start_hour: 18
            end_hour: 10
    ```

3.  Configure a Flex Gateway instance to debug the policy by placing a registration.yaml file in `playground/config`.

4.  Run the `run` command to start the Flex Gateway instance:

    ``` ssh
    make run
    ```

5.  Send requests to Flex Gateway:

    ``` ssh
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/catalog/1 -H "cache_check: cache_value"
    ```

    The upstream service used in the debugging environment included with PDK responds with an echo of the request.

6.  Send another request to Flex Gateway changing the included header:

    ``` ssh
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/catalog/1 -H "cache_check: cache_value1"
    ```

    If requests are made outside of business hours, the header cache_check: cache_value is included in the response body instead of cache_check: cache_value1. If requests are made inside of business hours, the header cache_check: cache_value1 is included in the response body.

7.  Change the non-business hours and request path to view different responses.
