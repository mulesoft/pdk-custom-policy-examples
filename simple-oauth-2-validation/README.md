# "simple-oauth-2-validation" Policy

## Development lifecycle
This project has a Makefile that includes different goals that assist the developer during the policy development lifecycle.

### Setup
The `make setup` goal installs the Policy Development Kit internal dependencies for the rest of the Makefile goals.
Since these dependencies are provided by the Anypoint Platform, it requires the user to be authenticated with a set of valid Anypoint credentials.

### Build asset files
The `make build-asset-files` goal generates all the policy asset files required to build, execute, and publish the policy. This command also updates the `config.rs` source code file with the latest configurations defined in the policy definition.

### Build
The `make build` goal compiles the WebAssembly binary of the policy.
Since the source code must be in sync with the policy definition configurations, this goal runs the `build-asset-files` before compiling.

### Run
The `make run` goal provides a simple way to execute the current build of the policy in a Docker containerized environment. In order to run this goal, the `playground/config` directory must contain a set of files required for executing the policy in a Flex Gateway instance:
- A `registration.yaml` file generated by performing a Flex Gateway registration in Local Mode. If you already have an instance registered in Local mode, you can reuse the registration file you have and copy it in the `playground/config` folder.
Otherwise, to complete the registration we recommend using the Anypoint Platform:
    1. Go to `Runtime Manager`
    2. Navigate to the `Flex Gateway` tab
    3. Click the `Add Gateway` button
    4. Select `Docker` as your OS and copy the registration command replacing `--connected=true` to `--connected=false`.
    5. Paste the command and run it in the `playground/config` directory.

- An `api.yaml` file updated with the desired policy configuration. This file also supports adding other policies to be applied along the one being developed.

The `playground/config` directory can also contain other resource definitions, such as accessory services used by the policy (Eg. a remote authentication service).

### Test
The `make test` goal runs unit tests and integration tests. Integration tests are 
placed in the `tests` directory and are configured with the files placed at the
`tests/<module-name>/<test-name>` directory.

### Publish
The `make publish` goal publishes the policy asset in Anypoint Exchange, in your configured Organization.

Since the publish goal is intended to publish a policy asset in development, the _assetId_ and name published will explicitly say `dev`, and the versions published will include a timestamp at the end of the version. Eg.
- groupId: your configured organization id
- visible name: _{Your policy name} Dev_
- assetId: _{your-policy-asset-id}-dev_
- version: _{your-policy-version}-20230618115723_

### Release
The `make release` goal also publishes the policy to Anypoint Exchange, but as a ready for production asset. In this case, the groupId, visible name, assetId and version will be the ones defined in the project.
